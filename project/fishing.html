                The Wasatch Front as well as the Wasatch Back produce many opportunities for great fishing. many
                of the local reservoirs are stocked on a schedule. One of the more famous fishing areas in this region
                include Strawberry Reservoir. Although you can fish from the shore it is best from boat. Ice fishing
                is also popular at this location. There are other lakes in the area, but if you are more of a river
                fisher then Provo River is most likely the source for you.

                The Uintaâ€™s capture my heart with the vast opportunities it produces with its fishing environments.
                So many lakes and rivers to choose from. Mirror Lake is one of the most famous in the South Slope area.
                Further north of course you have Flaming Gorge with the Green River Flowing South through the state.
                Both the North and South slopes have a varieties of lakes. One of my favorite stops is Pass Lake. It is
                a quick hop of the main road for some quick fun. For the more serious fisherman you may want to do a
                little hiking or backpacking to find your ideal spot.

                So, the state of Utah offers up some wonderful locations to fish, but there is none better than
                Fish Lake. It offers both warm water and ice fishing. This is a deep natural lake that offers a large
                selection. You will find Arctic Grayling (one of my favorites), Lake Trout, Splake, Perch, Mackinaw,
                Rainbow Trout, Tiger Trout, Kokanee Salmon, German Brown Trout, Yellow Perch, and Tiger Muskie.
                Less common but still found in Fish Lake are Large Mouth Bass.
