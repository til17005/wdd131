                This is in my own backyard. Like any hunter, I would never tell you specifically where I go.
                That is my secret to keep, but there are plenty of areas to hunt, fish, camp, backpack, or
                just take a day hike. Plenty to hunt from Deer, Elk, Moose, Black Bear, and more. Watch out
                for those famous Cougars.

                This is a little further than my backyard, but oh so worth the travel. The High Uinta Wilderness
                is some of my favorite in the state. Many have heard of Mirror Lake, but that is a small wonder
                in this vast wildereness. For hunting they divide it into the North Slope and the South Slope.
                Again, I won't tell you where my spots are, but it is wide open. This is where I love to fish as well.
                So many options and so little time. It is magnificent with all the options it provides for
                those that love the outdoors. I would consider this area the prime for hunting in Utah.

                This is my choice for many family outings. Southern Utah has so much to offer. The famous Arches
                National Park rests right outside the small city of Moab. Canyonlands is close by with Dead Horse
                Point on the way. Further south you will find Goblin Valley, Escalante Staircase, and Bryce Canyon.
                Of course, you have Cedar City and St. George down South as well. With plenty of recreation and
                exploring
                to be done, you may need to take weeks or even months to get half of all you want, then come back for
                more. Southern Utah is a grand place to hunt big game. There is plenty of it around. Big game thrives in
                Southern Utah.
